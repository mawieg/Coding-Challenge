## Coding Challenge
This is my submission for a coding task for a position as data scientist. 

The task was to define a time series, to translate it to its symbolic representation using Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), and to compute the frequency of each SAX symbol. Furthermore, the task was to provide a graphical user interface to explore the impact of various parameters. I chose frame size and alphabet size as these parameters.
